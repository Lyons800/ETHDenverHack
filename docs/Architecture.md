# Governance Architecture

Conflicts and divergent interests are settled through negotiation, while agreements and promises are managed contractually.

Missions are statements of desires. _What_ members want to archive and strive for. Proposing a new mission is an expression of oppinion that there might be some interesting stuff to make happen.

Two things that needs to get voted on:
- Allocating DAO owned resources towards some specific tasks (guild bounties, treasury, real estate, DAO controled social media influence)
- Veto vote to express missalignment between a specific mission statement and the DAO participants values

Proposing a mission and working towards it can be done by any single DAO member. Nobody is able to stop you from doing anything, but the DAO can officially state that it is opposed to certain missions and furthermore stop providing resources to such a mission.

The idea is that there is a huge virtual space of possible archivements to strive for, regardless of whether they get accounted for explicitly or not. Given the large space of possibilities it is easier to say what you don't want compared to explicitly expressing consent about everything.
