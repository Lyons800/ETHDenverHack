# DAI: Decentralised Autonomous Intelligence

# Overview

## Why?

DAOs don't work (currently). Operations are non efficient, processes are not automated, and decisions are not decentralised.

DAOs are fundamentally composed of departments or interests such as development, design, legal, operations and other interest sections with ideologically aligned individuals. 

These groups are constrained by the broad democratic approach a DAO takes to all decision making and operations. Unless the DAO adopts a significantly more centralised approach where a centralised entity such as a “core team” has the power to push these decisions to product. 

Not only is this approach a security risk, it is not decentralised or autonomous in any way. 


## How ?

Naturally a DAO breaks into entities of interests and ideas that push decisions and contact the entity in “control” of the DAO to push proposals or an idea. 

By using these entities as the foundation of the DAO, we have the ability to create groups of experienced localised representative democracy. 

Entities in a DAO, or Guilds, already run to create ideas and proposals to push towards the wider DAO, with one of two outcomes, a successful snapshot proposal, or a centralised decision by the “core team”. 

Why not use guilds to decentralise and automate processes within the DAO. The fundamentals are in place but the organisational infrastructure and governance to allow these Guilds to do so is complex and underdeveloped. 

By creating a charter or proposal for each Guild, containing scope, budget and governance rights along with a separate multi-sig wallet, we can allow guilds within a DAO to operate and function within these constraints. This will establish a significantly more automated and decentralised process for successful and efficient operations in a DAO. 

Each guild's scope and budget is voted on by the wider DAO as well as the ability for the DAO to propose changes to this at any stage , meaning you still have a democratic approach to governance. 

This model is also still decentralised as there is the ability for any member to join a guild onboarding process. 


## What?

### Membership 

Guilds are effectively sub-DAOs. These sub-DAOs are token gated using the native guilds ERC-721 token. This token is non-transferrable. Guilds operate in “seasons” which can be quarters or certain periods that are defined by the guilds scope. Each season, the guild has the opportunity to remove bad actors from a system that can be executed through a vote.

When a user holds one of these “soulbound” NFT’s, they are a member of the respective guild. E.g. if a user mints a non-transferable Development Guild, they are a member of the Development Guild.

When users are members of Guilds, they can partake in voting, bounties, quality assurance of bounties and other operations within the guild. 

### Onboarding

In order to become a member of a guild, users must complete open bounties or tasks to enter the guild. This is to promote experienced or enthusiastic members, curating a sub-community of ideologically aligned driven individuals.

Guilds and their members will have the duty of creating open bounties and tasks to be published to the community. These bounties can assist the DAO or a product in some way, or just be a single purpose test to allow new member onboarding. Therefore, this can be a once off creation and/or consistent product development opportunity. 

When a guild member is interested in a guild, they can view the open or closed bounties using Trello, DeWork, Wonder or similar. 

Multiple members can submit to open bounties and upon quality assurance, gain access to the guilds. Closed bounties work similar but have greater rewards and can only be submitted by one member.

This access is granted through the minting of a ‘non-transferrable’ ERC-1155 token. 

When the bounty is submitted, a quality assurance transaction is automatically submitted.
This transaction can be signed by the holders of these ‘Guild’ NFTs (non-transferrable 1155). 
Upon successful submission of the transaction, a NFT is minted to the submitter. 



### Quality Assurance

In order to pass the onboarding phase, users must go through a “competency screening” process. Members in guilds should have some experience or enthusiasm towards operations within the guild. In order to automate this process, DAI: has built a bounty quality assurance mechanism. 

When a user submits a bounty, the quality assurance transaction is initiated. Users holding the specific guild NFTs can vouch or vote for bounties they believe to be committed to a good standard. This removes the need for centralised and non-autonomous decision making for Guild onboarding. Addressing the scalability problem of growing guilds. 

When a guild member vouches for a transaction, they must provide logical reasoning for the quality assurance. This voting decision and the reasoning, are minted in the metadata of the NFT. Using AI and/or IEML to analyse large datasets of proposals and reasoning, we can identify outliers and bad actors within the system. 

Each time a quality check is performed, guild members that voted with identified logical reasoning gain credibility and share of a quality assurance prize pool based on the proposal rewards amount. 

When the bounty quality check tx passes a specified quorum (voted on by the guild members), the transaction mints the submitter a ‘soulbound’ NFT representing their newly acquired membership to that guild. 

### Voting

Guilds will have a scope defining the extent of their operations. However, in order for these operations to be carried out, guilds must adopt a democratic voting system to make these decisions. Members holding Guild NFTs have the ability to vote on proposals within guilds. 

All users can view these proposals, however in order to vote, you MUST have the respective Guild NFT. 

When a user votes, they must provide logical reasoning as to why they have taken the position on that vote. Once provided, an NFT is minted with that reasoning and vote. 

All proposal reasoning is run through text classification to determine bad actors in the system. E.g. A user that enters lorem ipsum for their 50 char limit will be an outlier in the model and identified. 

Voting will be hidden from other guild members using zero knowledge proofs. This will ensure that people do not vote in accordance with the majority and strive for a more accurate and fair voting system.


### Bounties

Bounties within guilds are used only for product development. These bounties require proven credibility (Guild NFT Status) and will often result in higher rewards than “onboarding Bounties”. 

These bounties are only accessible by guild members and upon completion, enter similar quality assurance to the onboarding bounties. Upon successful quality assurance of a bounty, the submission address is minted an NFT with the bounty details.
